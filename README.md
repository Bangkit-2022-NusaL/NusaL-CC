# NusaL-CC
Bangkit 2022 Product-based Capstone Project - NusaL - CC

This is Cloud Computing repository for NusaL application.

# Introduction
NusaL is an Android application supported with a REST API using the ExpressJs Framework for Node.js and MongoDB as the database. This API is then being deployed using Google App Engine (GAE) with its database (MongoDB) using a Virtual Machine from Google Compute Engine (GCE).

# Deployment
* **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
  * **Prerequisites** <br>
    Here are several points to consider before proceeding:
   * Install or update to the latest version of the **Google Cloud CLI**
   * Set a default region and zone `asia-southeast2-a`
   * Enable **Compute Engine** and **App Engine** APIs
    <br>
  * **Google Compute Engine (GCE)** <br>
      Before deploying the application to cloud, we have to make sure that we have the database readyâ€”where in this case we are using MongoDB. To achieve this, we are using GCE to initiate a Virtual Machine (VM) that will run on cloud. <br>
      To initiate a VM,
     * On GCP console, go to **Navigation Menu -> Compute Engine -> VM instances**
      * Click on **Create Instance**
      * Specify a VM name `mongo-nusal`
      * Use the previously set region and zone `asia-southeast2-a`
      * Select Machine Configuration using series `E2` and machine type `e2-medium` <br>
        > Since need it for general purposes only, E2 machines offers a good balance of price and performance, and are suitable for a wide variety of common workloads including databases.
      * In the **Boot disk** section, click **Change**, and then do the following:
        1. On the Public images tab, choose the following:
         * Operating System `Ubuntu`
         * OS version `18.04`
         * Boot disk type `Balanced persistent disk`
         * Boot disk size `10GB`
        2. For advanced configuration options, click **Show advanced configuration**
