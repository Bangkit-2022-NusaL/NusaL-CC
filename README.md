# NusaL-CC
Bangkit 2022 Product-based Capstone Project - NusaL - CC

This is Cloud Computing repository for NusaL application.

# Introduction
NusaL is an Android application supported with a REST API using the ExpressJs Framework for Node.js and MongoDB as the database to **store the user data**. This API is then being deployed using Google App Engine (GAE) with its database (MongoDB) using a Virtual Machine from Google Compute Engine (GCE).

# Deployment
* **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
  * **Prerequisites** 
    <br>
    Here are several points to consider before proceeding:
    * Install or update to the latest version of the **Google Cloud CLI**
    * Set a default region and zone `asia-southeast2-a`
    * Enable **Compute Engine** and **App Engine** APIs 
      <br><br>
  * **Google Compute Engine (GCE)** 
      <br>
      * **Create Virtual Machine (VM)**
          Before deploying the application to cloud, we have to make sure that we have the database readyâ€”where in this case we are using MongoDB. To achieve this, we are using GCE to initiate a Virtual Machine (VM) that will run on cloud. 
          <br><br>
          To initiate a VM,
           * On GCP console, go to **Navigation Menu -> Compute Engine -> VM instances**
           * Click on **Create Instance**
           * Specify a VM name `mongo-nusal`
           * Use the previously set region and zone `asia-southeast2-a`
           * Select Machine Configuration using series `E2` and machine type `e2-medium` 
             <br>
             > Since need it for general purposes only, E2 machines offers a good balance of price and performance, and are suitable for a wide variety of common workloads including databases.
           * In the **Boot disk** section, click **Change**, and then do the following:
             * On the Public images tab, choose the following:
                * Operating System `Ubuntu`
                * OS version `18.04`
                * Boot disk type `Balanced persistent disk`
                * Boot disk size `10GB`
           * Allow both `HTTP Traffic` and `HTTPS Traffic` Firewalls
           * Click on the **Management, security, disks, sole tenancy** section, go to the **Networking** tab and do the following:
             1. Add a new network tag `mongo`
             2. On **Network Interfaces**, edit the `default` and make sure its external IP address is **Ephemeral** 
           * Leave everything else as default
           * Click **Create** instance
         <br><br>
     * **Create Firewall**
      After Creating the VM, we have to make another Firewall is response to the `mongo` network tag to enable a default port number for MongoDB instances.
      <br>
      To create a new Firewall,
       * On GCP console, go to **Navigation Menu -> VPC Networks -> Firewall**
       * Click on **Create Firewall**
       * Specify a Firewall name `default-mongo-port`
       * Set target tags `mongo`
       * Set source IP ranges `0.0.0.0/0`
       * In the **Protocols and ports** section, Click on **Specified protocols and ports** and do the following:
         - Check `tcp`
         - Set the port number to be `27017`
            > Port 27017 is the default port number for mongod and mongos instances
       <br><br>
