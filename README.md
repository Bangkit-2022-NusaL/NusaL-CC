# NusaL-CC
Bangkit 2022 Product-based Capstone Project - NusaL - CC

This is Cloud Computing repository for NusaL application.

# Introduction
NusaL is an Android application supported with a REST API using the ExpressJs Framework for Node.js and MongoDB as the database. This API is then being deployed using Google App Engine (GAE) with its database (MongoDB) using a Virtual Machine from Google Compute Engine (GCE).

# Deployment
* **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
  * **Prerequisites** <br>
    Here are several points to consider before proceeding:
  * Install or update to the latest version of the Google Cloud CLI.
  * **Google Compute Engine (GCE)** <br>
Before deploying the application to cloud, we have to make sure that we have the database ready—where in this case we are using MongoDB. To achieve this, we are using GCE to initiate a Virtual Machine that will run on cloud. <br><br>
To initiate a Virtual Machine, 
  * **Google App Engine (GAE)**
 
* **Heroku: Cloud Application Platform**

# Library
